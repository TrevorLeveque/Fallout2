<center><p>Getting a fallout shelter is a must when the nukes come raining down. It must be a very accessible fallout shelter than you can get too quickly when you hear those air raid sirens.</p></center>

<center><p>Start picking through your gold old American coins to be looking for copper, silver and anything else that will be useful to you once the dollar bill becomes worthless.</p></center>
<center><p>Get some type of armory so you can defend yourself. Those friendly neighbors won't be so friendly when they hardly have a brain!</p></center>
<center><p>Gather much needed supplies such as:</p></center>
<ul>
<li>Canned food</li>
<li>Lots and lots of water</li>
<li>Radiation suits</li>
<li> Geiger Counters</li>
<li>Clothing</li>
<li>Basic thing you don't want to be totally irradiated when you come back, such as Family Heirlooms.</li>

<p>President Truman is a powerful president and he will help keep us safe but what happens when he leaves office? What then we may be attacked without charismatic skills to help us out of those sticky situations! </p>
<p>As time goes on you will have to come out of your fallout shelter so you must be prepared for the horrors of radiation to come. Once large building reduced to little but rubble and bent and twisted metal. We have taken many tests and have reviewed them from other sectors and have come conclusive that without current technology we can not keep a two story building standing as of now.<p/>
<p> As the time comes closer and closer when the reds may invade the US you will most definitely need an arsonal do defend yourself. The government may have already been taken over by the reds so do not trust anyone. <p/>
<p> Record home videos, get toys from your past you will feel very gloomy spending as many years as you can down in those shelters. But if you're some of them here rich folk. Head on over to some of the many resorts in your area! They will write your names down and will assure you that a spot is reserved for you when the time comes. They have a number of fallout shelter located inside, under or near the resorts.<p/>

<p> As time goes on you will need to rebuild the life you had before the war. Such as restoring proper government, rebuilding schools. Making life the way it was with just a little more radiation than you are used too! <p/>
